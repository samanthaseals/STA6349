**1. Suppose we roll two fair dice and you keep track of the larger of the two rolls.**

**a. What is the sample space?**
    
**b. Let $X$ = the larger of the two numbers. Derive the probability distribution.**

**c. Verify that your answer in (b) is a valid probability distribution.**

**2. A man with 5 keys wants to open the door and tries keys at random. Exactly one key will open the door. Assume that unsuccessful keys are eliminated from future attempts.**

**a. What is the sample space?**

**b. Let $X$ = the key's number that opens the door. Derive the probability distribution.**

**c. Verify that your answer in (b) is a valid probability distribution.**

**d. Take the code in lecture used to simulate values and edit to simulate 1000 trials. Graph the resulting distribution.**

**3. A standard drug is known to be effective in 80% of the cases in which it is used. A new drug is tested on 100 patients and found to be effective in 85 cases. Is the new drug superior? (Hint: Use R to find the probability of observing 85 or more successes assuming that the new and old drugs are equally effective.)**

**4. CHALLENGE! Let the number of chocolate chips in a certain type of cookie have a Poisson distribution. Suppose that, on average, there are 7 chocolate chips per cookie.**

**a. Use R to find the probability of two chocolate chips in a cookie.**

**b. Use R to find the probability of at least two chocolate chips in a cookie.**

**c. Simulate the results from 10000 cookies and graph the resulting distribution.**
