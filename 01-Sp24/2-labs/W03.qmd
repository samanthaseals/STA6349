**1. Suppose we roll two fair dice and you keep track of the larger of the two rolls.**

**a. What is the sample space?**
    
**b. Let $X$ = the larger of the two numbers. Derive the probability distribution.**

**c. Verify that your answer in (b) is a valid probability distribution.**

**2. A man with 5 keys wants to open the door and tries keys at random. Exactly one key will open the door. Assume that unsuccessful keys are eliminated from future attempts.**

**a. What is the sample space?**

**b. Let $X$ = the key's number that opens the door. Derive the probability distribution.**

**c. Verify that your answer in (b) is a valid probability distribution.**

**d. Take the code in lecture used to simulate values and edit to simulate 1000 trials. Graph the resulting distribution.**

**3. A standard drug is known to be effective in 80% of the cases in which it is used. A new drug is tested on 100 patients and found to be effective in 85 cases. Is the new drug superior? (Hint: Use R to find the probability of observing 85 or more successes assuming that the new and old drugs are equally effective.)**

**4. CHALLENGE! Let the number of chocolate chips in a certain type of cookie have a Poisson distribution. Suppose that, on average, there are 7 chocolate chips per cookie.**

**a. Use R to find the probability of X chocolate chips in a cookie.**

**b. Use R to find the probability of at least X chocolate chips in a cookie.**

**c. Simulate the results from 10000 cookies and graph the resulting distribution.**

**$^*$ Note: Room 1, X = 2; Room 2, X = 4; Room 3, X = 8.**

**5. You are waiting at your local ATM machine and as usual, you are waiting in a line. Suppose you know that your waiting time can be between 0 to 5 minutes and any value between 0 and 5 minutes is equally likely.**

**a. What is the average wait time?**

**b. What is the standard deviation of wait time?**

**c. Find the probability that you wait more than 2 minutes.**

**d. Find the probability you wait between 2 and 3 minutes.**

**e. Use R to answer parts c and d.**

**6. In the "waiting for a bus" example, suppose you record the median time T (in minutes) you wait for the bus on three days. The density function is given by**

$$f_T(t) = \frac{6t(10-t)}{1000}, \ \ t \in (0, 10)$$

**a. CHALLENGE! Graph the density function. (Hint: look into creating a vector with `seq()`.)**

**b. CHALLENGE! Graph the density function and show what area corresponds to $P[5 \le T \le 7]$. Note: it is okay if you do not figure this out, but please document what you attempted for full credit.**

**7. Suppose that the AAA reports that the average time it takes to respond to an emergency call on the highway is 25 minutes. Assume that the times to respond to emergency calls are approximately Normally distributed with mean 25 minutes and standard deviation 4 minutes.**

**a. Use R to answer this question. If your car gets stuck on a highway and you call the AAA for help, find the probability that it will take longer than 30 minutes to get help.**

**b. Use R to answer this question. Find the probability that youâ€™ll wait between 20 and 30 minutes for help.**
