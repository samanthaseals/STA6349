<!-- This is a HTML comment. It will not appear in the rendered file. -->

```{r example}
# this is a R comment. it will show in the rendered file when the chunk is set to display
# for this file, we have the default chunk option set to display (controlled by the `echo` option in the yaml)

# this differently colored section is called a code chunk
# we can add code chunks using the green button with a C on it in the toolbar
# we can also add code chunks using a keyboard shortcut.

# at the beginning of the chunk, we told the file that it needs to use R to analyze what is here
# we also gave the chunk a name; you can see the chunks and their names at the bottom of this panel
```

```{r no_show}
#| echo: false # this is a chunk option
# by setting echo to false, we are telling Quarto to suppress this code chunk in the output
```

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
# if the above line throws an error, remove the # from the next line and run it
#install.packages("tidyverse")
# once library(tidyverse) works, delete the commented section here
# leaving certain commands in a .qmd file will keep it from rendering properly
# view(dataframe) is another one that will prevent rendering
```

**1. What is your name? Change the font color to be your favorite color. Note: this is asking for you to write HTML code. It is *not* R code.**

<font color="#d7a2db">Dr. Seals</font>

**2. Is there a nickname you go by that you would like to go by in the classroom? Change the font to be Italicized.**

Dr. Seals

**3. What are your career goals after you are finished with the program? Change the font to be underlined.**

When I was in your shoes (finishing a master's degree here at UWF), I knew I wanted to teach at the university level... so going after a PhD was my next step. I was fortunate to be able to choose between programs in mathematics, statistics, and biostatistics.

**4. What questions do you have about this course? Write them using an enumerated list.**

Insert your answers here :)

**5. What is the keyboard shortcut to render this file?**

Insert your answer here :)

**6. Render this file using the keyboard shortcut and tell me where the resulting .html file saved to.**

Insert your answer here :)

**7. What is the keyboard shortcut to add a code chunk?**

Insert your answer here :)

Insert code chunk here. Add your favorite animal as a comment inside of the chunk.

**8. What is the keyboard shortcut to run a single line within a code chunk?**

Insert your answer here :)

**9. Import the dataset located on Canvas.**

```{r}

```

**10. Find an interesting (to you!) dataset from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and import it here.**

```{r}
library(haven)
analysis1 <- read_sas("~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/STA6235 Modeling in Regression/0-data/analysis1.sas7bdat", 
    NULL)
```


**11. Use functions within `tidyverse` to find an appropriate summary statistic for one variable in the dataset. Hint: Dr. Google is your friend! Try searching "summary statistic tidyverse".**



**12. Bonus! Use `ggplot()` to construct a visualization relevant to the dataset.**
