## Introduction {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Today we will review probability basics

    - ... next week we will get into probability distributions.

- Bayesian analysis all hinges on Bayes Theorem, which requires an understanding of probability.

- Today's material comes from <u>[Probability and Bayesian Modeling](https://bayesball.github.io/BOOK/probability-a-measurement-of-uncertainty.html)</u>

## Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The classical view of probability is the most simple,

$$ P[\text{outcome}] = \frac{1}{\text{number of outcomes}}$$

- Example: Suppose we have an urn with 4 blue marbles and 4 green marbles inside (Go Argos!), and we draw a marble from the bowl at random.

    - What are the possible outcomes?
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a blue marble?
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a green marble?

- The classical view of probability is the most simple,

$$ P[\text{outcome}] = \frac{1}{\text{number of outcomes}}$$

- Example: Suppose we have an urn with 4 blue marbles and 4 green marbles inside (Go Argos!), and we draw a marble from the bowl at random.

    - What are the possible outcomes? *blue*, *green*
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a blue marble? *1/2*
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a green marble? *1/2*
    
- Note that this works because the outcomes (*blue*, *green*) were *equally likely*.    

## Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The frequency view of probability allows for outcomes with unequal probabilities,

$$ P[\text{outcome}] = \frac{\text{number of outcomes meeting criteria}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}$$

- Example: Suppose we have an urn with 4 blue marbles and 1 green marble inside (Go Argos!), and we draw a marble from the bowl at random.

    - What are the possible outcomes? 
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a blue marble? 
    
    - What is the probability of drawing a green marble?

## Sample Space {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- In order for us to fully understand probability and its calculation, we must understand the sample space.

- The sample space lists all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

- What is the sample space if we roll two fair dice?

## Events and Event Operators {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Nomenclature:
    
    - $S$, the sample space for the random experiment.

    - $A$, the event of interest; a subset of $S$.

- We can combine events as we do with sets,

    1. $A \cap B$ is the *intersection* between $A$ and $B$; it is the event that both $A$ and $B$ occur.

    2. $A \cup B$ is the *union* between $A$ and $B$; it is the event that either $A$ or $B$ occur.

    3. $A^c$ is the *complement* of $A$; it is the event that $A$ does not occur.

## Events and Event Operators {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Example: Suppose we are going to ask a random person what month they were born.

    - What is the sample space?
    
    - Define events:
    
        - $L$ for the person being born in the last half of the year and 
        
        - $F$ for those born during a montht that is four letters long
        
    - Explain the set $L \cap F$ is.
    
    - Explain the set $L \cup F$ is.
    
    - Explain the set $L^c$.
    
## Events and Event Operators {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Example: Suppose we are going to ask a random person what month they were born.

    - What is the sample space? $$S=\{\text{Jan.}, \text{Feb.}, \text{March}, \text{April}, \text{May}, \text{June}, \text{July}, \text{Aug.}, \text{Sept.}, \text{Oct.}, \text{Nov.}, \text{Dec.} \}$$
    
    - Define events:
    
        - $L$ for the person being born in the last half of the year, $L = \{\text{July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.}  \}$
        
        - $F$ for those born during a month that is four letters long, $F = \{ \text{June, July} \}$
        
    - Explain the set for $L \cap F$. *$L \cap F$ is the event that the person is born in the last half of the year AND is born in a four letter month.*
    
    - Explain the set for $L \cup F$. *$L \cup F$ is the event that the person was EITHER born during the last half of the year OR born in a four letter month.*
    
    - Explain the set for $L^c$. *$L^c$ is the event that the person was NOT born during the last half of the year.*

## Intersections  {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><image src="images/W02-L1-b.png" width=800></center>

- The intersection of two events will be the outcomes shared between the two events.

- In the above Venn Diagram, $A \cap B = \{ 6, 12 \}$.

## Mutually Exclusive/Disjoint {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><image src="images/W02-L1-c.png" width=800></center>

- Two events are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if the intersection (overlap) between the two sets results in the empty set, $A \cap B = \{ \emptyset \}$

- As demonstrated above, the Venn Diagram shows no overlap between the two events.

## Unions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"}

<center><image src="images/W02-L1-b.png" width=500><image src="images/W02-L1-c.png" width=500></center>

- The union of two events will be all outcomes possible between the two events.

    - In the case of an intersection, we must not count those outcomes twice.

## Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><image src="images/W02-L1-c.png" width=500></center>

- If events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then 

$$ P[A \cup B] = P[A] + P[B] $$

- This can be extended to more than two events:

$$ P[A \cup B \cup C \cup D] = P[A] + P[B] + P[C] + P[D] $$

## Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Consider a standard 52 card deck.

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-e.png" width=800></center>

- What is the probability of drawing a King?

- What is the probability of drawing a King, Queen, or Jack?

## Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- What is the probability of drawing a King?

$$P[\text{K}] = 4/52 = 1/13 = 0.0769$$
- What is the probability of drawing a King, Queen, or Jack?

$$
\begin{align*}
P[\text{K} \cup \text{Q} \cup \text{J}] &= P[\text{K}] + P[\text{Q}] + P[\text{J}] \\
&= 4/52 + 4/52 + 4/52 \\
&= 0.2308
\end{align*}
$$

## General Addition Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- For any two events, $A$ and $B$,

$$ P[A \cap B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \cup B] $$

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-b.png" width=500></center>

## General Addition Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Consider a standard 52 card deck.

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-e.png" width=800></center>

- What is the probability of drawing a King or a diamond?

## General Addition Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-e.png" width=800></center>

$$ 
\begin{align*}
P[A \cup B] &= P[A] + P[B] - P[A \cap B] \\
P[\text{K} \cup \text{diamond}] &= P[\text{K}] + P[\text{diamond}] - P[\text{K} \cap \text{diamond}] \\
&= 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 \\
&= 0.3077
\end{align*}
$$

## Complements {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-f.png" width=500></center>

- If $S$ is the sample space of a probability experiment and $E$ is an event, then $E^c$ is all outcomes in $S$ that are not outcomes in the event $E$.

- Example: Consider rolling a fair die. If $A$ is rolling a 3 or 5, what is $A^c$?

## Complements {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

<center><img src = "images/W02-L1-f.png" width=500></center>

- If $S$ is the sample space of a probability experiment and $E$ is an event, then $E^c$ is all outcomes in $S$ that are not outcomes in the event $E$.

- Example: Consider rolling a fair die. If $A$ is rolling a 3 or 5, what is $A^c$? $A^c = \{1, 2, 4, 6\}$.

## Complements {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Complement Rules:

$$
\begin{align*}
    &P[A] + P[A^c] = 1 \\
    &P[A^c] = 1 - P[A] \\
    &P[A] = 1 - P[A^c]
\end{align*} 
$$

- Example: Consider rolling a fair die. If $A$ is rolling a 3 or 5, find $P[A]$ and $P[A^c]$.

## Complements {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Complement Rules:

$$
\begin{align*}
    &P[A] + P[A^c] = 1 \\
    &P[A^c] = 1 - P[A] \\
    &P[A] = 1 - P[A^c]
\end{align*} 
$$

- Example: Consider rolling a fair die. If $A$ is rolling a 3 or 5, find $P[A]$ and $P[A^c]$. 

    - $P[A] = 2/6$
    
    - $P[A^c] = 1 - P[A] = 1-2/6 = 4/6$

## Independent Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Two events are independent if the occurrence of event $A$ does not affect the probability of event $B$.

- If events are not independent, we say that they are dependent.

- Example: Flipping a fair coin twice.

    - The results of the first flip do not affect the second flip.
    
- Example: Rolling two dice.
    
    - What is rolled on the first die does not affect what is rolled on the second die.
    
## Multiplication Rule for Independent Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then

$$ P[A \cap B] = P[A] \times P[B] $$

- We can extend this. If $E_1$, $E_2$, ... $E_n$ are all independent events, then

$$ P[E_1 \cap E_2 \cap ... \cap E_n] = P[E_1] \times P[E_2] \times ... \times P[E_n]$$

- Example: Consider flipping two coins. What is the probability of two heads?

## Multiplication Rule for Independent Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then

$$ P[A \cap B] = P[A] \times P[B] $$

- We can extend this. If $E_1$, $E_2$, ... $E_n$ are all independent events, then

$$ P[E_1 \cap E_2 \cap ... \cap E_n] = P[E_1] \times P[E_2] \times ... \times P[E_n]$$

- Example: Consider flipping two coins. What is the probability of two heads?

    - Let event $A$ be heads and event $B$ be heads, then,

$$
\begin{align*}
    P[A \cap B] &= P[A] \times P[B] \\
    &= 1/2 \times 1/2 \\
    &= 1/4
\end{align*}
$$  
    
## Conditional Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- If $A$ and $B$ are any two events, then

$$P[A|B] = \frac{P[A \cap B]}{P[B]} = \frac{N(A \cap B)}{N(B)}$$

- Conditional probability:
    
    - $P[A|B]$ is the probability of event $A$ given event $B$. 

    - It is the probability that event $A$ occurs given that event $B$ has occurred.
    
- Example: Suppose a single die is rolled. We are told the outcome will be an odd number. What is the probability that the die comes up three?

## Conditional Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- If $A$ and $B$ are any two events, then

$$P[A|B] = \frac{P[A \cap B]}{P[B]} = \frac{N(A \cap B)}{N(B)}$$

- Conditional probability:
    
    - $P[A|B]$ is the probability of event $A$ given event $B$. 

    - It is the probability that event $A$ occurs given that event $B$ has occurred.
    
- Example: Suppose a single die is rolled. We are told the outcome will be an odd number. What is the probability that the die comes up three?

  - $S = \{1, 3, 5\}$
  
  - $P[\text{rolling a 3} | \text{outcome is odd}] = 1/3$
  
## General Multiplication Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The probability that two events $A$ and $B$ both occur is

$$P[A \cap B] = P[A] \times P[B|A] = P[B] \times P[A|B] $$ 

- Example: Let event $A$ be a driver who is speeding gets pulled over and event $B$ be a driver pulled over gets a ticket. The probability that a driver who is speeding gets pulled over is 0.8. The probability that a driver gets a ticket given that they are pulled over is 0.9. What is the probability that a randomly selected driver who is speeding gets pulled over and gets a ticket?

## General Multiplication Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The probability that two events $A$ and $B$ both occur is

$$P[A \cap B] = P[A] \times P[B|A] = P[B] \times P[A|B] $$ 

- Example: Let event $A$ be a driver who is speeding gets pulled over and event $B$ be a driver pulled over gets a ticket. The probability that a driver who is speeding gets pulled over is 0.8. The probability that a driver gets a ticket given that they are pulled over is 0.9. What is the probability that a randomly selected driver who is speeding gets pulled over and gets a ticket?

$$
\begin{align*}
P[A \cap B] &= P[A] \times P[B|A] \\
    &= 0.8 \times 0.9 \\
    &= 0.72
\end{align*}

- Today we have discussed the basics about probability.

    - Sample spaces and events
    - Intersections and unions
    - Mutually exclusive or disjoint events
    - Addition rules
    - Multiplication rules
    
- Next week we will dive into probability distributions.
