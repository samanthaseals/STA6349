## Problem Statement

- Imagine you find yourself standing at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, captivated by the artwork in front of you. 
    
- While understanding that "modern" art doesn’t necessarily mean "new" art, a question still bubbles up: what are the chances that this modern artist is Gen X or even younger, i.e., born in 1965 or later? 
    
- Let $\pi$ denote the proportion of artists represented in major U.S. modern art museums that are Gen X or younger. 
    
- The Beta(4,6) prior model for $\pi$ reflects our own very vague prior assumption that major modern art museums disproportionately display artists born before 1965, i.e., $\pi$  most likely falls below 0.5. 
    
- After all, "modern art" dates back to the 1880s and it can take a while to attain such high recognition in the art world.

- We must be able to utilize this posterior to perform a rigorous posterior analysis of  $\pi$.

- There are three common tasks in posterior analysis: 

    - estimation, 
    - hypothesis testing, and 
    - prediction. 
    
- For example, 

    - What’s our estimate of  $\pi$?
    
    - Does our model support the claim that fewer than 20% of museum artists are Gen X or younger? 
    
    - If we sample 20 more museum artists, how many do we predict will be Gen X or younger?

## Posterior Estimation {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We can construct **posterior credible intervals**.

    - Let $\theta$ have posterior pmf $f(\theta|y)$.
    
    - A posterior credible interval (CI) provides a range of posterior plausible values of $\theta$, and thus a summary of both posterior central tendency and variability. 
    
    - A middle 95% CI is constructed by the 2.5th and 97.5th posterior percentiles, $$\left( \theta_{0.025}, \theta_{0.975} \right),$$ and there is a 95% posterior probability that $\theta$ is in this range,
    
$$P\left[ \theta \in (\theta_{0.025}, \theta_{0.975})|Y=y \right] = \int_{\theta_{0.025}}^{\theta_{0.975}} f(\theta|y) d\theta = 0.95$$    

## Posterior Estimation {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall the Beta(18, 92) posterior model for $\pi$, the proportion of modern art museum artists that are Gen X or younger. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## 95% CI

```{r}
qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 18, 92)
```

- There is a 95% posterior probability that somewhere between 10% and 24% of museum artists are Gen X or younger.

## 99% CI

```{r}
qbeta(c(0.005, 0.995), 18, 92)
```

- There is a 99% posterior probability that somewhere between 9% and 26% of museum artists are Gen X or younger.

## 50% CI

```{r}
qbeta(c(0.25, 0.75), 18, 92)
```

- There is a 50% posterior probability that somewhere between 14% and 19% of museum artists are Gen X or younger.

- 95% is a common choice, however, note that it is somewhat arbitrary and used because of decades of tradition.

- There is no one right credible interval.

    - It will just depend on the context of the analysis.

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose we read an article claiming that fewer than 20% of museum artists are Gen X or younger. 

<center><img src = "images/W13-L1-b.png"></center>

- How plausible is it that $\pi < 0.2$?

$$
P\left[ \pi < 0.2 | Y = 14 \right] = \int_0^{0.2} f(\pi|y = 14) d\pi
$$

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Posterior Probability

$$
P\left[ \pi < 0.2 | Y = 14 \right] = \int_0^{0.2} f(\pi|y = 14) d\pi
$$

- We can find this probability by using the `pbeta()` function:

```{r}
pbeta(0.20, 18, 92)
```

- Thus, 

$$
P\left[ \pi < 0.2 | Y = 14 \right] = 0.849
$$

- There is approximately an 84.9% posterior chance that Gen Xers account for fewer than 20% of modern art museum artists.

- Prior Probability

$$
P\left[ \pi < 0.2 | Y = 14 \right] = \int_0^{0.2} f(\pi|y = 14) d\pi
$$

- We can find this probability by using the `pbeta()` function:

```{r}
pbeta(0.20, 4, 6)
```

- Thus, 

$$
P\left[ \pi < 0.2 | Y = 14 \right] = 0.086
$$

- There is approximately an 8.6% prior chance that Gen Xers account for fewer than 20% of modern art museum artists.

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- **Hypotheses and Probabilities**

    - $H_0: \ \pi \ge 0.2$; $P\left[ H_0 | Y = 14 \right] = 0.151$
    - $H_1: \ \pi < 0.2$; $P\left[ H_1 | Y = 14 \right] = 0.849$

::: {.panel-tabset}
    
## Posterior Odds 

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{posterior odds} &= \frac{P\left[ H_1 | Y = 14 \right]}{P\left[ H_0 | Y = 14 \right]} \\
&= \frac{0.849}{0.151} \\
&\approx 5.62
\end{align*}
$$ 

- Our posterior assessment suggests that $\pi$ is 5.2 times more likely to be *below* 0.2 rather than being *above* 0.2.

## Prior Odds

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{prior odds} &= \frac{P\left[ H_1 | Y = 14 \right]}{P\left[ H_0 | Y = 14 \right]} \\
&= \frac{0.086}{0.914} \\
&\approx 0.094

- Bayes Factor

    - When we are comparing two competing hypotheses, $H_0$ vs. $H_1$, the Bayes Factor is an odds ratio for $H_1$:
    
$$
\text{Bayes Factor} = \frac{\text{posterior odds}}{\text{prior odds}} = \frac{P\left[H_1 | Y\right] / P\left[H_0 | Y\right]}{P\left[H_1\right] / P\left[H_0\right]}
$$

- We will compare this value to 1.

    - BF = 1: The plausibility of $H_1$ did not change in light of the observed data.
    
    - BF > 1: The plausibility of $H_1$ increased in light of the observed data.
    
        - The greater the Bayes Factor, the more convincing the evidence for $H_1$.
        
    - BF < 1: The plausibilty of $H_1$ decreased in light of the observed data.

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- It's time to draw a conclusion!

    - Posterior probability: 0.85
    - Bayes factor: 60
    
- We have fairly convincing evidence in factor of the claim that fewer than 20% of artists at major modern art museums are Gen X or younger.
    
- This gives us more information - we have a holistic measure of the level of uncertainty about the claim.

    - This should help us inform our next steps.
    
## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We now want to test whether or not 30% of major museum artists are Gen X or younger.

$$
\begin{align*}
H_0&: \ \pi = 0.3 \\
H_1&: \ \pi \ne 0.3
\end{align*}
$$

- Why is this an issue?
    
$$
P\left[ \pi =0.3 | Y = 14 \right] = \int_{0.3}^{0.3} f(\pi|y = 14) d\pi = 0
$$

- and even worse,

$$
\text{posterior odds}  = \frac{P\left[ H_1 | Y = 14 \right]}{P\left[ H_0 | Y = 14 \right]} = \frac{1}{0}
$$

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Welp.

## Posterior Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Welp.

- Let's think about the 95% posterior credible interval for $\pi$: (0.10, 0.24).

    - Do we think that 0.3 is a plausible value?
    
- Let's reframe our hypotheses:

$$
\begin{align*}
H_0&: \ \pi \in (0.25, 0.35) \\
H_1&: \ \pi \not\in (0.25, 0.35)
\end{align*}
$$

- Now, we can more rigorously claim belief in $H_1$.

    - The entire hypothesized range is above the 95% CI.
    
- This also allows us a way to construct our hypothesis test with posterior probability and Bayes Factor.
