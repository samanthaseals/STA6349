## 2.2: Probability and Inference {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- In statistics we use probabilities to make inference, or draw conclusions.

- Consider a gambler who wishes to make an inference concerning the balance, or fairness, of a die. 

    - If the die were perfectly balanced, one-sixth of the measurements in this population would be 1s, one-sixth would be 2s, one-sixth would be 3s, etc.

## 2.2: Probability and Inference {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Using the scientific method, the gambler proposes the hypothesis that the die is balanced, and he seeks observations from nature to contradict the theory, if false.

    - A sample of ten tosses is selected from the population by rolling the die ten times. 
    
    - All ten tosses result in 1s. üßê
    
    - The gambler looks upon this output and concludes that his hypothesis is not in agreement with nature and, thus, the die is not balanced.
    
- The gambler rejected his hypothesis not because it is *impossible* to throw ten 1s in ten tosses of a balanced die, but because it is *highly improbable*.    

## 2.3: Review of Set Notation {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose the elements $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are in the set $A$, we will write $$A = \left\{ a_1, a_2, a_3 \right\}$$

    - Notation: capital letters $\to$ *sets* of points.

- We can denote the set of all elements under consideration with $S$, the *universal set*.

## 2.3: Review of Set Notation {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- $\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\subset} \boldsymbol{B}$:

    - For any two sets $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ is a *subset* of $B$ if every point in $A$ is also in $B$.

- $\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\cup} \boldsymbol{B}$:

    - The *union* of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all points in either $A$ or $B$.
    
    - i.e., the union has all points that are in at least one of the sets.

- $\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\cap} \boldsymbol{B}$:

    - The *intersection* of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all points in both $A$ and $B$.
    
    - i.e., the intersection is where the two sets overlap.

- $\boldsymbol{\bar{A}}$ or $\boldsymbol{A^\text{c}}$:

    - The *complement* of $A$ is the set of points that are in $S$, but not in $A$.
    
    - $A \cup \bar{A} = S$.

- $\boldsymbol{A}$ $\boldsymbol{\cap}$ $\boldsymbol{B}$ $=$ $\boldsymbol{\emptyset}$:

    - Two sets, $A$ and $B$, are said to be *disjoint* or *mutually exclusive* when they have no points in common.
    
    - Related: for any set $A$, we know that $A$ and $\bar{A}$ are mutually exclusive.

## 2.3: Review of Set Notation {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Fast forwarding through set algebra, we need to know these *distributive laws*: 

$$
\begin{align*}
A \cap (B \cup C) &= (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \\ 
A \cup (B \cap C) &= (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\ 
\overline{(A \cap B)} &= \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \\
\overline{(A \cup B)} &= \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}
\end{align*}
$$

- Suppose two dice are tossed and the numbers on the upper faces are observed.

- Let $S$ denote the set of all possible pairs that can be observed.

    - e.g., (2, 3) indicates that a 2 was observed on the first die and a 3 on the second.
    
- Define the following subsets of $S$ and list their points:

    - $A$: The number on the second die is even.
    - $B$: The sum of the two numbers is even.
    - $C$: At least one number in the pair is odd.
    
- List the points in the following:

    - $A \cup B$
    - $A \cap \bar{B}$
    - $\bar{A} \cap C$

- *Experiment*: the process by which an observation is made.

    - Examples: 
    
        - coin and die tossing, 
        - measuring the systolic blood pressure of an individual, 
        - determine the number of bacteria per cubic centimeter in a serving of processed food.
    
- *Events*: the outcomes possible in an experiment.

    - Notation: capital leters
    
    - Examples for bacteria observation:
    
        - $A$: Exactly 110 bacteria are present.
        
        - $B$: More than 200 bacteria are present.
        
        - $C$: The number of bacteria present is between 100 and 300.

- *Sample space*, $S$: the set consisting of all possible sample points.

- The following Venn diagram shows the six simple events in $S$, 

$$S = \{E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, E_5, E_6 \}$$

- *Compound event*: A collection of sample points in a discrete sample space, $S$.

    - i.e., any subset of $S$.
    
- e.g., suppose we define two events, $A$ and $B$,

## 2.4: A Probabilistic Model for an Experiment {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose $S$ is a sample space associated with an experiment. 

- To every event $A$ in $S$ (i.e., $A \subset S$), we assign a number, $P[A]$, called the *probability of $A$*, such that the follow axioms hold:

    - Axiom 1: $P[A] \ge 0$.
    - Axiom 2: $P[S] = 1$.
    - Axiom 3: If $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ form a sequence of pairwise mutually exclusive events in $S$ 
    
        - Remember, mutually exclusive: $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ if $i \ne j$
    
$$P[A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ ... \cup \ A_n] = \sum_{i=1}^n P[A_i] $$

## 2.4: A Probabilistic Model for an Experiment {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose a sample space consists of five simple events, $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$, $E_4$, and $E_5$.

    - If $P[E_1] = P[E_2] = 0.15$, $P[E_3] = 0.4$, and $P[E_4] = 2P[E_5]$, find the probabilities of $E_4$ and $E_5$.
    
    - If $P[E_1] = 3P[E_2] = 0.3$, find the probabilities of the remaining simple events if you know that the remaining simple events are equally probable.

## 2.5: Calculating the Probability of an Event {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The following are steps used to find the probability of an event:

    1. Define the experiment and clearly determine how to describe one simple event.
    
    2. Define $S$: list the simple events associated with the experiment.
    
    3. Assign reasonable probabilities to the sample points in $S$, making sure that $P[E_i] \ge 0$ and $\sum_i P[E_i] = 1$.
    
    4. Define the event of interest, $A$, as a specific collection of sample points.
    
    5. Find $P[A]$ by summing the probabilities of the sample points in $A$.
    
## 2.5: Calculating the Probability of an Event {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose we toss a balanced coin three times.

- Use the steps to find the probability of exactly two of the three tosses result in heads.

- The odds are two to one that when $A$ and $B$ play tennis, $A$ wins. Suppose that $A$ and $B$ play two matches. 

- Use the steps to find the probability that $A$ wins at least one match.

## 2.6: Tools for Counting Sample Points {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let us discuss some results from combinatorial theory.

- We want to be able to count the total number of sample points in the sample space, $S$.

- Sometimes we use this method to efficiently find probabilities. 

    - If a sample space contains $N$ equiprobable sample points and an event $A$ contains exactly $n_a$ sample points, then
    
$$
P[A] = \frac{n_a}{N}    
$$

- **Theorem**: 

    - With $m$ elements $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_m$ and $n$ elements $b_1$, $b_2$, ..., $b_n$, it is possible for form $mn = m \times n$ pairs containing one element from each group.

- Consider an experiment that consists of recording the birthday for each of 20 randomly selected persons. 

- Ignoring leap years and assuming that there are only 365 possible distinct birthdays, find the number of points in the sample space $S$ for this experiment. 

- If we assume that each of the possible sets of birthdays is equiprobable, what is the probability that each person in the 20 has a different birthday?

- *Permutation*: an ordered arrangement of $r$ distinct objects, $P_r^n$.

$$
P_r^n = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

- Remember, *factorials* are defined as follows:

$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 2 \times 1
$$

- With special factorials:

$$
\begin{align*}
1! &= 1 \\
0! &= 1
\end{align*}

- *Combination*: the number of subsets formed from $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, $C_r^n$ or ${n \choose r}$.

- **Theorem**:

    - The number of unordered subsets of size $r$ chosen without replacmeent from $n$ available objects is 
    
$$ 
{n \choose r} = C_r^n = \frac{P_r^n}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r(n-r)!}
