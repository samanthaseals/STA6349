## 2.7: Conditional Prob. and Independence of Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- *Conditional probability* of an event $A$ given that an event $B$ has occurred is as follows

$$
P[A|B] = \frac{P[A \cap B]}{P[B]},
$$

- so long as $P[B] > 0$.

- Notation: $P[A|B]$ is the probability of $A$ *given* $B$.

## 2.7: Conditional Prob. and Independence of Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose that a balanced die is tossed once. Find the probability of rolling a 1, given that an odd number was obtained.

## 2.7: Conditional Prob. and Independence of Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be *independent* events if any one of the following holds:

$$
\begin{align*}
P[A|B] &= P[A] \\
P[B|A] &= P[B] \\
P[A \cap B] &= P[A] P[B]
\end{align*}
$$

- Otherwise, we say that $A$ and $B$ are *dependent* events.

## 2.7: Conditional Prob. and Independence of Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Consider the following events in the toss of a single die:

    - $A$: Observe an odd number.
    - $B$: Observe an even number.
    - $C$: Observe a 1 or 2.
    
- Are $A$ and $B$ independent events?

- Are $A$ and $c$ independent events?

## 2.7: Conditional Prob. and Independence of Events {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Three brands of coffee, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, are to be ranked according to taste by a judge. 

- Consider the following events:

    - $A$: Brand $X$ is preferred to $Y$.
    - $B$: Brand $X$ is ranked best.
    - $C$: Brand $X$ is ranked second best.
    - $D$: Brand $X$ is ranked third best.
    
- If the judge actually has no taste preference and randomly assigns ranks to the brands, is event $A$ independent of events $B$, $C$, and $D$?    

## 2.8: Two Laws of Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- **Theorem**: The Multiplicative Law of Probability

    - The probability of the intersection of two events $A$ and $B$ is
    
$$\begin{align*}P[A\cap B] &= P[A] P[B|A] \\ &= P[B] P[A|B]\end{align*}$$
    
- Note that if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then
    
$$P[A \cap B] = P[A] P[B]$$

## 2.8: Two Laws of Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- **Theorem**: The Additive Law of Probability

    - The probability of the union of two events $A$ and $B$ is
    
$$P[A \cup B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \cap B] $$

- Note that if $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then $P[A \cap B] = 0$ and

$$P[A \cup B] = P[A] + P[B]$$

## 2.8: Two Laws of Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- **Theorem**: The Complement Rule

    - If $A$ is an event, then
    
$$
\begin{align*}
P[A] &= 1 - P[\bar{A}] \\
P[\bar{A}] &= 1 - P[A] \\
1 &= P[A] + P[\bar{A}]
\end{align*}
$$

## 2.8: Two Laws of Probability {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Suppose $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are three events and $P[A_1 \cap A_2] = P[A_1 \cap A_3] \ne 0$ but $P[A_2 \cap A_3] = 0$. Show that 

$$
P[\text{at least one } A_i] = P[A_1] + P[A_2] + P[A_3] - 2 P[A_1 \cap A_2]. 
$$

## 2.9: Calculating the Probability of an Event {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- The steps used to define the probability of an event:

    1. Define the experiment.
    
    2. Visualize the nature of the sample points. Identify a few to clarify your thinking.
    
    3. Write an equation expressing the event of interest ($A$) as a composition of two or more events, using usions, intersections, and/or complements. Make certain that event $A$ and the event implied by the compsotion represnt the sameset of sample points.
    
    4. Apply the additive and multiplicative laws of probability in the compositions obtained in step 3 to find $P[A]$.

- Of the voters in a city, 40% are Republicans and 60% are Democrats.

- Among the Republicans, 70% are in favor of a bond issue, where 80% of the Democrats favor the issue.

- If a voter is selected at random in the city, what is the probability that he or she will favor the bond issue?

- It is known that a patient with a disease with respond to treatment with probability equal to 0.9. 

- If three patients with the disease are treated independently, find the probability that at least one will respond.

## 2.10: The Law of Total Probability and Bayes' Rule {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- *Partition*:

    - For some positive integer $k$, let the sets $B_1, B_2, ..., B_k$ be such that
    
        1. $S = B_1 \cup B_2 \cup ... \cup B_k$
        
        2. $B_1 \cap B_j = \emptyset$, for $i \ne j$
        
    - Then the collection of sets $\{B_1, B_2, ..., B_k\}$ is said to be a *partition* of $S$.

- We also know that if $A$ is any subset of $S$ and $\{B_1, B_2, ..., B_k\}$ is a partition of $S$, $A$ can be *decomposed*:

$$
A = (A \cap B_1) \cup (A \cap B_2) \cup \ ... \ \cup (A \cap B_k)
$$

- **Theorem**:

    - Assume that $\{ B_1, B_2, ..., B_k \}$ is a partition of $S$ such that $P[B_i] > 0$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., k$. Then for any event $A$,
    
$$
P[A] = \sum_{i=1}^k P[A|B_i] P[B_i]
$$

- **Theorem**: Bayes' Rule

    - Assume that $\{ B_1, B_2, ..., B_k \}$ is a partition of $S$ such that $P[B_i] > 0$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., k$. Then
    
$$
P[B_j | A] = \frac{P[A|B_j] P[B_j]}{\sum_{i=1}^k P[A|B_i] P[B_i]}
$$

- An electronic fuse is produced by five production lines in a manufacturing operation. The fuses are costly, are quite reliable, and are shipped to suppliers in 100-unit lots. 

    - Because testing is destructive, most buyers of the fuses test only a small number of fuses before deciding to accept or reject lots of incoming fuses.

- All five production lines produce fuses at the same rate and normally produce only 2% defective fuses, which are dispersed randomly in the output. 

    - Unfortunately, production line 1 suffered mechanical difficulty and produced 5% defectives during the month of March. 
    
    - This situation became known to the manufacturer after the fuses had been shipped. 
    
- A customer received a lot produced in March and tested three fuses. One failed.

    - What is the probability that the lot was produced on line 1? 
    
    - What is the probability that the lot came from one of the four other lines?

- Of the travelers arriving at a small airport, 60% fly on major airlines, 30% fly on privately owned planes, and the remainder fly on commercially owned planes not belonging to a major airline. 

- Of those traveling on major airlines, 50% are traveling for business reasons, whereas 60% of those arriving on private planes and 90% of those arriving on other commercially owned planes are traveling for business reasons. 

- Suppose that we randomly select one person arriving at this airport. What is the probability that the person:

    a. is traveling on business?
    
    b. is traveling for business on a privately owned plane?
    
    c. arrived on a privately owned plane, given that the person is traveling for business reasons?
    
    d. is traveling on business, given that the person is flying on a commercially owned plane?

## 2.11: Numerical Events and Random Variables {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- *Random variable*:

    - A real-valued function for which the domain is a sample space.

- Let $Y$ denote a variable to be measured in an experiment.

    - Because the value of $Y$ will vary depending on the outcome of the experiment, it is called a *random variable*.
    
    - Each point in the sample space will be assigned a real number denoting the value of $Y$.

        - That is, it may vary from one sample point to another.

- Define an experiment as tossing two coins and observing the results. 

- Let $Y$ equal the number of heads obtained. 

    - Identify the sample points in S.
    
    - Assign a value of Y to each sample point
    
    - Identify the sample points associated with each value of the random variable $Y$.

    - Compute the probabilities for each value of $Y$.

## 2.12: Random Sampling {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- *Population*: collection of all elements of interest.

    - *Parameter*: numeric characteristic of the population

- *Sample*: subset of the population.

    - *Statistic*: numeric characteristic of the sample
    
- The method of sampling will affect the probability of a particular sample outcome.

    - Simple random sample.
    
    - Stratified random sample.
    
    - Cluster sample.
    
    - Systematic sample.

## 2.12: Random Sampling {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- *Sampling with replacement*: elements can be chosen more than once for inclusion in a sample.

    - This means every time we select an element for the sample, the possible choices from the population stay the same.

- *Sampling without replacement*: elements cannot be chosen more than once for inclusion in a sample.

    - This means every time we select an element for the sample, the possible choices from the population decrease.
    
- *Random sample*: each of the ${N \choose n}$ possible samples have equal probability of being selected.

    - $N$ is the population size
    
    - $n$ is the sample size
    
- If we need to randomize, we will use a random number generator to assign a random number, then reorder the dataset and take the first $n$ observations.
